Again, the ICCC would like to remind retailers who sell fuel using pumps to set fuel prices to one decimal place while the ICCC will continue to set the maximum price to 2 decimal places.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No fuel pump operator should charge above the Indicative Retail Price for this month&rsquo;s price regardless of the number of decimals.

On 12th November, 2009, Mainport entered into a share acquisition agreement (acquisition) with Kambang to acquire 17.6% of the 33.3% shares that Kambang held in Consort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prior to the acquisition, Kambang held 33.3% shares in Consort, Steamships Trading Company Limited held 33.3% shares in Consort and Anton Lee Transport Limited held the remaining 33.3% shares, comprising the total shares issued in and forming the issued capital of Consort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 31st August, 2009, before Mainport acquired the 17.6% shares from Kambang, Mainport was amalgamated into Steamships and legally ceased to exist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By acquiring the 17.6% shares from Kambang (through its subsidiary Mainport) Steamships had the majority shareholding interest in Consort at 50.9%.

In 2011, the Government developed the Electricity Industry Policy (EIP) which recommended for competition in the generation sector of the electricity industry. This allowed Independent Power Producers (IPP) to compete with PPL however because PPL has an exclusive rights within 10kms radius of its transmission network, most of the IPPs had to enter into Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with PPL to supply power for general consumption.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commissioner Ain added that since 2011, there are eight licensed electricity undertakers including PPL operating in the country. Of these, five are IPPs generating and supplying power to PPL. These IPPs are; ExxonMobil PNG Limited, Posco Daewoo Limited, PNG Forest Products Limited and New Britain Palm Oil Limited and Daewoo PNG Power Limited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;During the Regulatory Contract Review undertaken by the ICCC in 2012, the findings recommended tariff increases for PPL to have PPL met its cost of operation, investment, perform competitively in the market and deliver better services to the people of PNG. These tariffs were to take effect in 2013.&rdquo; Commissioner Ain said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The Government however made a decision in 2013 to stop PPL from increasing the electricity tariff. This decision to freeze the tariff increase has been in effect since the second quarter of 2013. PPL still has the prerogative to request the Government to rescind its decision if it feels that the tariff freeze is burdening PPL&rsquo;s financial performance.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015, a mid-term review of PPL&rsquo;s Regulatory Contract revealed that most of the capital projects that were planned for implementation by 2015 were not achieved. Further review of the Industry by the ICCC in 2017 also showed that PPL was yet to implemented most of its capital projects allowed for under the 2013 to 2017 Regulatory Contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In light of the Government&rsquo;s decision to freeze tariff increase since 2013, PPL was unable to charge electricity services on cost reflective basis subsequently PPL was not able make reasonable returns to implement the planned projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Third Party Access (TPA) Codes and Grid Codes are administered by ICCC and basically provide guidance to power producers in terms of pricing and technical aspect of the commercial arrangements are competitive, least-cost reflective and ensure international best practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commissioner Ain said that despite of set-backs from the tariff-freeze issue, the regulatory framework overseen by the ICCC through the use of TPA Codes, Regulatory Contract and Licences, amongst others have remained fruitful with the introduction of competition within the generation segment of the electricity industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The ICCC has ensured that the economic regulation of the industry remained relevant and in-tuned with the prevailing market conditions.

As a result, the review of this Authorization application did not proceed until on 30th January, 2018, when KCHL formally advised the ICCC to recommence the assessment of its Authorization application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ICCC Commissioner and Chief Executive Officer, Paulus Ain said this decision relates to the Authorization application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Authorization is a statutory process under the <em>Independent Consumer and Competition Commission Act 2002</em> (<strong>&ldquo;</strong>ICCC Act<strong>&rdquo;</strong>) that allows a business to seek exemption to proceed to engage in a business conduct that may otherwise raise competition concerns for the ICCC such as the acquisition of assets or shares of another business that would seriously harm competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commissioner Ain said, &ldquo;The Authorization test is that the net benefits to the society must be greater than the detriments likely to result from the conduct subject of an Authorization application; in this case the Proposed Merger of Telikom and DataCo&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The ICCC may grant Authorization for the Applicants to proceed with the merger <em>if it is broadly satisfied that the benefits will result, or will be likely to result, from it will outweigh any detriments &nbsp;to the community.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commissioner Ain further said that the proposed merger has been carefully considered consistent with these requirements and it has been conducted through a transparent consultation process by seeking the views and comments from industry participants, players, stakeholders and the general public. Based on this thorough process and the ICCC&rsquo;s own independent assessment of the telecommunication&rsquo;s industry market, the ICCC has considered that the Proposed Merger will affect the following relevant markets:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>The market for provision of international data transmission and connectivity which supports dark fibre, bit-rate and managed data services (that is, all three layers 1, 2 and 3 services);</li>\r\n	<li>The market for provision of domestic data transmission and connectivity which supports dark fibre, bit-rate and managed data services.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In its consideration of the likely effects on competition if the Proposed Merger proceeds, amongst others, the ICCC has formed the following conclusions:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>the ICCC considers that, although DataCo may be an &ldquo;insignificant&rdquo; player now, it can be a sustainable and effective competitor in the future, should sufficient investment is made in it hence it is considered that this merger will eliminate a potential competitor;</li>\r\n	<li>the ICCC also considered that the barriers to entry are high, hence the market position of the merged firm would be greatly enhanced because it would control the essential network infrastructures currently available in PNG;</li>\r\n	<li>although satellite is an available substitute, usage of fibre optic cables is a more efficient and better means of carrying traffic because it significantly reduces signal latency for voice calls and its bandwidth can be more easily enhanced over time;</li>\r\n	<li>the ICCC also considered that there is a real likelihood of the merged entity engaging in discriminatory pricing. However, the ICCC and NICTA has agreed to work together to address this concern. Appropriate regulatory measures will be put in place to address this concern.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>In its consideration of the likely public benefit claims, the ICCC took into account submissions and comments from stakeholders and interested parties. The ICCC has concluded that the following benefits will result from the Proposed Merger, should it proceeds:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Potential for increased price competition and consequent retail price reduction to end users;</li>\r\n	<li>Innovation and increased investment in new technology, hence the technical knowledge and skills gained by national employees;</li>\r\n	<li>Improved backhaul networks and greater access to the use of backhaul networks for retail operators which will benefit the end users of data and voice services;</li>\r\n	<li>Improved economic activity and efficiency for the parties in the long run; and</li>\r\n	<li>As a result of more aggressive competition in retail service offerings, there will be greater penetration of higher bandwidth data and voice services into smaller towns and rural locations which is currently enjoyed as a near monopoly by Digicel (which provides services at a lower bandwidth).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>As mentioned, the Authorization test is that, <em>the overall benefits from this acquisition must be greater than the detriments (which includes the substantial lessening of competition). </em>&nbsp;If so, then the ICCC must grant Authorization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commissioner Ain said that the ICCC has also concluded that the Proposed Merger, if it proceeds, will result in some serious detriments in substantially lessening competition and waste of public funds if the claimed benefits and efficiencies are not realized post-merger.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Weighing the likely benefits to the community against the potential detriments (which includes substantial lessening of competition), the ICCC has considered that there are considerable benefits to the community that will result from the merger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To minimize potential anti-competitive discrimination and restriction of access to essential network infrastructures, bring greater efficiency benefits into the telecommunication industry, and ensure that the benefits of this transaction outweigh any detriments, the ICCC wants to see that there is sufficient access readily available to incumbents and potential new entrants who have network or ISP licenses and require wholesale data transmission services. Hence, potential new entrants may enter the market and provide sufficient competition against the incumbents; hence the realization of the benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commissioner Ain said the ICCC is working with NICTA to ensure appropriate conditions are imposed to ensure access to essential infrastructures are readily available to potential new entrants. KCHL has also agreed to ensure third party access is not unnecessarily restricted or denied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This Authorization does not limit the ICCC in taking appropriate remedial actions in the event that, in future, the merged entity engages in any anti-competitive behavior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on the above considerations the ICCC has granted this Authorization for the Proposed Merger to proceed.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n',1,'0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,1,'{}',0,'{}',826,'','2018-05-22 02:39:12',826,'2018-05-22 02:42:51','','2018-05-22 02:42:51','0000-00-00 00:00:00',375,2948,'{\"image_intro\":null,\"image_intro_caption\":null,\"image_intro_alt\":null,\"image_fulltext\":null,\"image_fulltext_caption\":null,\"image_fulltext_alt\":null}','{}',0,2,47,'','',89,'',1),(14,'com_content.article','ICCC allows Air Niugini to code-share with Fiji Airways','iccc-allows-air-niugini-to-code-share-with-fiji-airways','<p>The Independent Consumer and Competition Commission (ICCC) wishes to inform key stakeholders and the general public that the ICCC has granted Authorization to Air Niugini Limited (Air Niugini) to enter into and give effect to a code-share agreement with Fiji Airways Limited on the Port Moresby (PNG) to Nadi (Fiji) route via Honiara.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ICCC Commissioner and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Paulus Ain said that on the 14th December, 2017, the ICCC received an application for Authorization from Air Niugini for it to enter into and give effect to a code-share agreement with Fiji Airways for a period of three years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The application was made pursuant to Section 70 of the <em>Independent Consumer and Competition Commission Act 2002</em> (<strong>ICCC Act</strong>). This code-sharing arrangement is the first between Air Niugini and Fiji Airways since their existence. Air Niugini will be operating the services between Port Moresby and Nadi.&rdquo; Commissioner Ain said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In assessing this application, the ICCC conducted a wider public consultation. The ICCC also released its Draft Determination for public and stakeholders&rsquo; comments on its assessment of the application and its reasoning for its proposed decision. The views of industry participants as well as other interested stakeholders were taken into consideration in finalising this Determination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commissioner Ain said: &ldquo;The ICCC has considered the principal market to be the market for the provision of air passenger services between Port Moresby and Fiji. It is also considered that the services from Australian ports to Fiji may have some competitive pressure on the principal market. For the purposes of assessing this application, the ICCC has considered the relevant market is the provision of regular air passenger services between PNG and Fiji, in particular, the Port Moresby and Nadi ports.&rdquo;<em> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, only Air Niugini is servicing the Port Moresby/Nadi (POM/NAN) route (via Honiara). Therefore, the ICCC believes this code-share arrangement would provide an opportunity for another carrier in Fiji Airways to enter the market through partnering with Air Niugini; and eventually grow its market share on the route; and may enter into a more competitive form of code-share arrangement or enter the market as an independent carrier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In its assessment of the public benefits this code-share is likely to generate, the ICCC has considered that the following would be achieved in the long run:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Travellers&rsquo; choice of marketing carriers would be increased (from one to two as currently it is only Air Niugini);</li>\r\n	<li>The arrangement would develop the route and make Port Moresby as a transit hub for passengers from New Zealand, United States, Honiara, Fiji and other Pacific Island nations to Asia and vice versa. This would increase traffic volume through Port Moresby and make it possible for more frequent services therefore, reducing passenger flight times to Asian destinations. This outcome would also lead to cheaper fares in the long run as a result of increased passenger volumes;</li>\r\n	<li>The possibility of Fiji Airways (and other Pacific carriers) to enter PNG market independently after growing its market share on this route; and</li>\r\n	<li>Provision of direct and increased frequency services.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides other likely detriments that may result from this proposed code-share, the ICCC also noted that the &lsquo;free sale&rsquo; code-share arrangement does not promote strong competition between the code-share partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hence, to minimise any potential anti-competitive effects and other related detriments to the public, the ICCC has imposed certain conditions to the Authorization. Amongst others, the following are the key conditions;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Air Niugini must price and sell its code-share services independently of Fiji Airways;</li>\r\n	<li>Air Niugini must revise its wholesale prices offered to Fiji Airways down once profitability is reached through increased passenger and freight volumes;</li>\r\n	<li>If, during the period of the Authorization, either of the parties increases airfares excessively without any valid justification on the code-share services, the ICCC will review the Authorization, pursuant to Section 80 of the ICCC Act, as such events may undermine the likely public benefits that this Authorization is based upon. The ICCC will then consider whether the balance between public detriment and public benefit still favours net public benefit;</li>\r\n	<li>Air Niugini is to submit annual code-share passenger and freight traffic volume reports to the ICCC, for the POM/NAN route; and&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Commissioner Ain said: &ldquo;Overall, the ICCC is satisfied that this code-share will result in more benefits to the public outweighing the potential detriments to competition in the market and other detriments. The ICCC therefore granted Authorization for a period of three years.</p>\r\n',1,'0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,1,'{}',0,'{}',826,'','2018-06-01 04:22:44',826,'2018-06-01 04:26:15','','2018-06-01 04:26:15','0000-00-00 00:00:00',377,2951,'{\"image_intro\":null,\"image_intro_caption\":null,\"image_intro_alt\":null,\"image_fulltext\":null,\"image_fulltext_caption\":null,\"image_fulltext_alt\":null}','{}',0,2,49,'','',89,'',1),(15,'com_content.article','ICCC Announces Retail Fuel Prices for June 2018','iccc-announces-retail-fuel-prices-for-june-2018','<p>The Independent Consumer and Competition Commission (<strong>&ldquo;ICCC&rdquo;</strong>) announces the new retail fuel prices for this month which will take effect on Friday, 8th June, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the ICCC&rsquo;s calculations, retail fuel prices for petrol, diesel and kerosene will all increase throughout PNG as of 8th June, 2018.

The demand has eventually eased off due to the completion of the PNG LNG Project, however, the hotel room rates have never subsided.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;</strong>In the last two or three years, there were more developments in hotel industry adding to new additional room with the expectation of the 2018 APEC Summit, hence, Port Moresby city appears to be well-positioned to meet an anticipated surge in foreign delegates arrival, despite delays on several high profile planned projects in the country.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commissioner Ain added that although there has been increase in the supply of hotel rooms, this is not reflected in the rates. Comparably, they are more expensive than some of the best hotels you find in another jurisdiction, including our very close neighbour economies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The room rates seem to be continuously increasing over the years, when will it decrease or when will the room rates come down?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ICCC views that supply of hotel rooms can be in excess of demand. This, according to Commissioner Ain, can cause a situation where some hotels can experience high room vacancy with falling revenue and profit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commissioner Ain said that given the increase in hotel rooms in Port Moresby compared to previous years, the hotel rates should be responsive to supply change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The room rates should decrease as the supply increases. Hotel supply has increased dramatically over the years in Port Moresby, but this change has not been reflected in the hotel room rates. The hotel room rates seem to be increasing significantly over the years.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the consumer watchdog, the ICCC is strongly urging all hoteliers to charge their rates prudently based on the real costs and the prevailing market conditions rather than on perception or historical trend or basing their price on their competitor&rsquo;s rate. If the hotels reduce their room rates, we can encourage more tourist coming to our country, it can also increase potential investors coming to our country to look for potential investment opportunities and finally we can have more people travelling to PNG during the APEC period.&nbsp; can benefit our APEC delegates and the country as a whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Commissioner Ain said all consumers have the right to choice, hence, they are encouraged to exercise their power of choice in seeking alternatives, if, a particular hotel room rates are excessive. That opportunity is limited given the current supply, therefore, price gouging by hoteliers should avoided.</p>\r\n',1,'0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,1,'{}',0,'{}',826,'','2018-08-14 04:26:20',826,'2018-08-14 04:27:50','','2018-08-14 04:27:50','0000-00-00 00:00:00',385,2981,'{\"image_intro\":null,\"image_intro_caption\":null,\"image_intro_alt\":null,\"image_fulltext\":null,\"image_fulltext_caption\":null,\"image_fulltext_alt\":null}','{}',0,2,54,'','',89,'',1),(20,'com_content.article','Increase in Telikom Data Rates','increase-in-telikom-data-rates','<p>The Independent Consumer and Competition Commission (ICCC) is aware of the recent increase in data rates for the 4G services offered by Kumul Telikom Limited (Telikom).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ICCC Commissioner and Chief Executive Officer, Mr Paulus Ain, said &ldquo;We express grave concern over the very high increase on the data rates.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Ain stated that the ICCC&rsquo;s role is not only to protect consumers from harmful business conduct; but to also ensure that business are able to compete fairly and effectively in a market so that they can earn sufficient profits to continue to invest in the business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Businesses should not be restrained from being able to charge rates for the services and products they provide. However, such rates should be fair and reasonable and that should reflect actual investments costs for the business in providing the service or product.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the meantime, the ICCC advises the public to exercise their choice if they feel aggrieved by the new data rates offered by the two companies and seek other alternative services provided by other operators that offer the same 4G services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whilst the exponential increase in Telikom&rsquo;s data rates may be detrimental to consumers, the ICCC is limited in terms of its regulatory powers to take remedial actions. Currently, the ICCC does not regulate the prices of data services; hence, it cannot take actions against such increases that may be over and above a fair or reasonable price.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consumers have protected rights under the ICCC Act. One of the most important rights being the &ldquo;right to choice&rdquo;. Depending on the facts surrounding the allegations of inflated prices, the ICCC may insist on Telikom to justifying its costs. In this regard, the ICCC will establish a dialogue with both Telikom and the industry regulator, the National Information and Communications Technology Authority (NICTA), to ascertain the basis of the sudden increase in the data rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ICCC understands that an employee of Telikom came out in one of the dailies claiming that the increases were due to costs of vandalism and maintenance. The ICCC believes these reasons are not sufficient to justify a very huge increase because price increase may be spread overtime to recover such costs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ICCC reiterates that Telikom should be reasonable and charge a price that is reflective of its costs so that they earn a fair return on their investment. Telikom should act as a good corporate citizen and be ethical in its conduct; and not using its near monopoly position in data services to their advantage by inflating prices unnecessarily to the detriment of the consumers. Telikom should be also cautious in its conduct as consumers may eventually switch to other operators who offer similar services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding whether this conduct of Telikom should be considered as abuse of its (near) monopoly position, the ICCC advises that the ICCC Act does not consider such price increases as abuse of monopoly position.</p>\r\n',1,'0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,1,'{}',0,'{}',826,'','2018-08-17 01:39:25',826,'2018-08-17 01:40:19','','2018-08-17 01:40:19','0000-00-00 00:00:00',386,2983,'{\"image_intro\":null,\"image_intro_caption\":null,\"image_intro_alt\":null,\"image_fulltext\":null,\"image_fulltext_caption\":null,\"image_fulltext_alt\":null}','{}',0,2,55,'','',89,'',1),(21,'com_content.article','ICCC DENIES CLEARANCE FOR PROPOSED ACQUISTION OF NEW PACIFIC LINE BY CHINA NAVIGATION COMPANY ','iccc-denies-clearance-for-proposed-acquistion-of-new-pacific-line-by-china-navigation-company','<p>The Independent Consumer and Competition Commission (&ldquo;ICCC<strong>&rdquo;</strong>) wishes to inform industry stakeholders and the general public that it has declined to give Clearance to China Navigation Company Pte Ltd (&ldquo;CNCO&rsquo;&rsquo;) to proceed with the proposed Acquisition of assets of New Pacific Line Pte Ltd (&ldquo;New Pac&rsquo;&rsquo;).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CNCo has applied for Clearance and Authorization to acquire the business and assets of NewPac (&ldquo;<strong>Proposed Acquisition</strong>&rdquo;).

The ICCC must decline Authorization should it form a view that the public detriments outweigh public benefits put forward by the applicant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The determination on the Authorization application is expected by 12th October, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ICCC&rsquo;s Clearance Determination can be accessed on its website: <a href=\"http://www.iccc.gov.pg/\">www.iccc.gov.pg</a> or interested stakeholders can contact the ICCC Head Office at Garden City, Boroko (NCD) to obtain a hard copy.</p>\r\n',1,'0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,1,'{}',0,'{}',826,'','2018-08-31 05:27:21',826,'2018-08-31 05:29:29','','2018-08-31 05:29:29','0000-00-00 00:00:00',387,2985,'{\"image_intro\":null,\"image_intro_caption\":null,\"image_intro_alt\":null,\"image_fulltext\":null,\"image_fulltext_caption\":null,\"image_fulltext_alt\":null}','{}',0,2,56,'','',89,'',1),(22,'com_content.article','ICCC to commence investigation into the acquisition of Markham Farming Company by East New Britain Oil Limited','iccc-to-commence-investigation-into-the-acquisition-of-markham-farming-company-by-east-new-britain-oil-limited','<p>The Independent Consumer and Competition Commission (&ldquo;ICCC<strong>&rdquo;</strong>) will commence an independent investigation into the acquisition of Markham Farming Company Limited (MFCL) by New Britain Palm Oil Limited (NBPOL).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ICCC advised that even though MFCL and NBPOL announced that the acquisition was completed on 23rd August, 2018, both parties never obtained a Clearance or an Authorisation from the ICCC.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ICCC Commissioner and CEO, Paulus Ain said it is important for businesses to apply for Clearance or Authorisation from the ICCC to safeguard the concerned parties from potential legal action from the ICCC or any aggrieved third parties under the ICCC Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The ICCC administered a voluntary merger notification regime under the ICCC Act where businesses were not required to apply for Clearance or Authorisation for any proposed merger or acquisition. However, on 25th July, 2018, the ICCC Act was amended by Parliament making it mandatory for parties to a merger or an acquisition to give notice seeking a clearance from the ICCC if the merger or acquisition fell within certain thresholds.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Mr Ain, the transaction value of the recent acquisition of K174million was well within the thresholds for giving a notice seeking clearance from the ICCC which was K50 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Ain, however, explained that the acquisition is not subject to the new thresholds because the new amended ICCC Act is yet to be certified by the Speaker&rsquo;s Office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite this Mr Ain said that businesses should still apply for a Clearance or Authorisation under the ICCC Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This is because in the event that the new amended ICCC Act is certified and gazetted, the amended ICCC Act may be made retrospective and come into effect on the date that it was passed by Parliament, which is 25th July 2018. Failure to give notice seeking clearance from the ICCC is an automatic fine of K750, 000.00. Therefore, to safeguard businesses from this potential effect, they should apply for a Clearance or Authorisation if the proposed acquisition would be completed after 25th July 2018.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Ain further stated that the ICCC reserves its rights under the ICCC Act to investigate any consummated acquisitions and take legal action if it is satisfied that the acquisition would have the effect of substantially lessening competition in a market in PNG.</p>\r\n',1,'0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,1,'{}',0,'{}',826,'','2018-08-31 05:29:57',826,'2018-08-31 05:32:19','','2018-08-31 05:32:19','0000-00-00 00:00:00',388,2987,'{\"image_intro\":null,\"image_intro_caption\":null,\"image_intro_alt\":null,\"image_fulltext\":null,\"image_fulltext_caption\":null,\"image_fulltext_alt\":null}','{}',0,2,57,'','',89,'',1),(23,'com_content.article','ICCC responds to Minister Duma’s statement on Telikom charges','iccc-responds-to-minister-duma-s-statement-on-telikom-charges','<p>The Independent Consumer and Competition Commission (ICCC) wishes to respond to the article titled <strong><em>&ldquo;Why Telikom raised charges: Duma&rdquo;</em></strong> which appeared in <em>The National</em> newspaper<em> </em>(30 August, p.5).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While responding to questions by East Sepik Governor Hon. Alan Bird on the recent hike in mobile phone services fees and charges by Telikom, Public Enterprise and State Investment Minister Hon.

Minister Duma stated that;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><em>&ldquo;</em><em>Internet and telephone charges and prices are fixed by the Independent Competition Consumer Commission.&rdquo;</em></li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a <em>&ldquo;170 per cent increase&rdquo;</em> in mobile phone service fees charged by Telikom <em>&ldquo;remains to be clarified by ICCC&rdquo;;</em></li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;There are certain increases that have been approved by ICCC</em>&rdquo;; and</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that necessary increases <em>&ldquo;have been approved by ICCC to enable our companies to provide decent dividends for our people.&rdquo;</em></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>ICCC Commissioner and Chief Executive Officer, Paulus Ain said that the statements made by Minister Duma, and reported by the media, is indeed inaccurate and misleading. It only further increases the divide and public misconception on the role of the ICCC in the Information, Communications and Technology (ICT) Industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Ain said under the <em>National Information Communications Technology Act 2010</em>, NICTA is the ICT regulator and it is entirely responsible for setting the tariff/rates, attending to consumer complaints, issuing licences, setting interconnection rates and monitoring their service standards of all its licences and all other players in the ICT industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is imperative to note that prior to 2010, the ICCC was the economic regulator of the telecommunication industry and that it was responsible for setting the tariff/prices of telecommunication services and the inter-connection rates between the competing telecommunication service providers. During that time, the Papua New Guinea Telecommunication and Radio-communication Technical Authority (PANGTEL) was the technical regulator of the industry responsible for, amongst other things, issuance of spectrum licenses and bandwidths to industry participants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, n 2010, the Government repelled the <em>Telecommunications Act</em> and replaced it with the NICTA Act 2010 and it established a new Authority called the National Information and Communications Technology Authority (NICTA). The new Authority or NICTA took over the role of the former PANGTEL as the technical regulator and the economic regulatory function of the ICCC that were previously performed by the ICCC and PNAGTEL.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Ain said, since 2010, NICTA is the legislated or mandated Authority responsible for both the economic and technical regulation for the entire ICT industry. Amongst other economic regulatory functions of the ICCC that has been transferred to NICTA includes; setting of the prices or rates of mobile and fixed line telephony services, wholesale internet bandwidth rates, interconnection rates for mobile and fixed line telephony, monitoring of the service standards and issuance of operator licences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Ain said prior to 2010, the ICCC has many success stories as the economic regulatory of the telecommunications industry, one that stands out today is the successful issuance of mobile operator&rsquo;s licence to Digicel PNG Limited in 2007.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adding to this Commissioner Ain said, &ldquo;It is therefore important for all concerned stakeholders to understand that NICTA is the telecommunication industry regulator by law and is directly responsible for regulating the prices of telecommunication services and service standards of the&nbsp; operators in that industry. It [NICTA] is the sector specific regulator of the telecommunication industry and is duty bound to perform its mandated role under its legislation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Users of telecommunication services also need to know that NICTA has a consumer affairs branch that deals with Information Communication Technology (ICT) service queries. This facility can be utilized by aggrieved consumers.&rdquo; Commissioner Ain said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consistent with Government policy, the ICCC, as an implementation agency, only regulates the prices of Electricity, Water, Fuel, Essential Port Services, Motor Vehicles 3rd Party Insurance premiums, Postal Services, PMV and Taxi Fares. It also monitors the factory gate prices of Rice, Flour and Sugar but does not set the prices of these goods. Commissioner Ain added that prices of all other goods and services in the PNG economy are determined by the market forces of demand and supply or by industry/sector specific regulators where these are subject to regulations; and not the ICCC.&nbsp; All stakeholders need to be informed and educated about these facts. Unfortunately, Minister Duma has miss interpreted the facts. Similarly, many consumers and the general public also continue to misinterpret the facts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commissioner Ain added that given the ICCC continues to maintain its competition and consumer watchdog role, it continues to receive consumer complaints regarding telecommunication issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;In most cases, these are referred to NICTA to investigate as the sector regulator because NICTA is best placed to deal with these complaints and queries. NICTA has successfully assisted customers on the same with and without the assistance of the ICCC.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Thus, concerned users of telecommunication goods and services should not shy away from approaching NICTA directly and request that it investigates their complaints and queries. Where complaints are laid with the ICCC, these will be referred to NICTA to assess and resolve.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In closing, Commissioner Ain said the ICCC will continue to work with NICTA, the sector regulator, on issues requiring our joint competency.</p>\r\n',1,'0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,1,'{}',0,'{}',826,'','2018-09-04 01:22:41',826,'2018-09-04 01:25:18','','2018-09-04 01:25:18','0000-00-00 00:00:00',389,2989,'{\"image_intro\":null,\"image_intro_caption\":null,\"image_intro_alt\":null,\"image_fulltext\":null,\"image_fulltext_caption\":null,\"image_fulltext_alt\":null}','{}',0,2,58,'','',89,'',1),(24,'com_content.article','RETAIL FUEL PRICES - SEPTEMBER, 2018','retail-fuel-prices-september-2018','<p>The Independent Consumer and Competition Commission (<strong>&ldquo;ICCC&rdquo;</strong>) hereby announces the new retail fuel prices for this month which will take effect on Saturday, 08th September, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the ICCC&rsquo;s calculations, retail fuel prices for petrol, diesel and kerosene will all increase throughout PNG as of 08th September, 2018.

The reason for the overcharging is a result of the current road construction in various parts of the city causing traffic congestion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ICCC Commissioner and CEO, Paulus Ain said PMV operators are reminded to refrain or immediately cease this conduct/practice or will be prosecuted under the <em>Prices Regulations</em> <em>Act</em> (PR Act) and the <em>Independent Consumer and Competition Commission Act 2002</em> (ICCC Act).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The ICCC will continue to monitor through its complaints help desk&nbsp; those PMVs that are overcharging commuters during short trips on a route, particularly for routes 9 and 11 travelling from 4 mile to Waigani and Gerehu.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commissioner Ain also encouraged passengers to assist the ICCC by providing the following details to the ICCC office:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Plate number of the bus;</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>The particular route the offence occurred;</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>The time of the day and the date the offence occurred;</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>The name of the owner of the bus (written on the driver&rsquo;s door);</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>&nbsp;Any distinguishing descriptions of the bus; and </strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>Complainant&rsquo;s name and contact details. </strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The above details can be provided by contacting the ICCC by telephone on 325 4615 &nbsp;or 325 2144 , or by walking in at the <strong>ICCC Head office located on the 1st &nbsp;Floor, Garden City &nbsp;Building, Boroko.
