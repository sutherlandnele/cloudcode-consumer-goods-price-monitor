The Commission also has the added responsibility of conducting special inquiry on economic productivity of certain industry as when directed by Minister or Parliament under PART VIII of the ICCC Act.</p>\r\n<p>The Commission only regulates the prices of certain goods and services declared by the Government through the Minister for Treasury under Section 10 of the PR Act for price regulation purposes. Under Section 32A of the PR Act, the ICCC monitors the prices of these goods and services. In its role of regulating these declared goods and services, the Commission powers are very much limited to only the baskets of declared goods and services after having deregulated most of the goods and services allowing the market forces to determine the prices. These declared goods and services can be found under Declared Goods and Services with special mention on the productivity matters that the ICCC does in carrying out special and specific industry reviews subject to direction from the Government though the Minister for Treasury.</p>\r\n<p>In choosing the form of price regulation that should apply to each of these declared goods and services, the Commission is required to consider the options that are available and are identified in the PR Act such as the price control under Section 10 of the PR Act and the price monitoring under Section 32A of the PR Act. Price control would require the Commission to have regard to the provisions of Sections 20A, 20B, and 21 of the PR Act. Price monitoring on the other hand under Section 32A of the Act provides a less intrusive method for price regulation.</p>\r\n<p>Under the price monitoring approach the suppliers of declared goods and services set their own prices according to their cost drives, while the Commission monitors these price movements with some independent price comparator. If the price are moving at rate not consistent with the movement in the price comparator, the commission may recommend to the Minister for Treasury to redeclare the goods and services for direct price control.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>','',1,97,'2017-12-20 07:10:20',560,'','2018-03-18 04:54:07',560,0,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2017-12-20 07:10:20','0000-00-00 00:00:00','{\"image_intro\":null,\"image_intro_caption\":null,\"image_intro_alt\":null,\"image_fulltext\":null,\"image_fulltext_caption\":null,\"image_fulltext_alt\":null}','{}','{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\",\"sunfw_article_type\":\"standard\",\"sunfw_featured_image\":\"\",\"sunfw_audio_embed_code\":\"\",\"sunfw_link_title\":\"\",\"sunfw_link_url\":\"\",\"sunfw_quote_text\":\"\",\"sunfw_quote_author\":\"\",\"sunfw_video_url\":\"\"}',10,7,'','',1,1818,'{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}',0,'*',''),(145,502,'Regulated Industries','regulated-industries','<div class=\"iccc-article-title\">\r\n<h3>Industry and Entity Regulation</h3>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"main\" style=\"overflow: auto;\">\r\n<div class=\"iccc-figure-common\">\r\n<p><img class=\"iccc-figure-common-scaled\" src=\"images/iccc/photogalleries/RID.jpg\" alt=\"Regulatory Industry Divisional Staff - Head Office\" /></p>\r\n<p>Regulatory Industry Divisional Staff - Head Office</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"iccc-article-text-content\">\r\n<p>The Regulated Industries Division is responsible for regulating infrastructure and service sectors in Papua New Guinea under Part III of the Independent Consumer and Competition Commission Act 2002.

We also regulate national infrastructure services. Our primary responsibility is to ensure that individuals and businesses comply with PNG competition, fair trading, and consumer protection laws - in particular the Independent Consumer and Competition Commission Act 2002.</p>\r\n<p>Our goals and priorities are outlined in the 2017 - 2019 Corporate Plan document. This is a very succinct plan. It sets out our priorities and strategies for the next three years. It provides a brief framework of how we intend to administer the Independent Consumer and Competition Commission Act 2002 (ICCC Act) and related legislation, the regulatory instruments through which industries are regulated, consumers are protected and competition is safeguarded and enhanced.</p>\r\n<p>Through this plan we aspire to fulfill the Government\'s vision of wealth creation and to improve the standard of living of Papua New Guineans by creating \"a progressive and globally competitive environment\" for the conduct of business. this means, freeing up the national economy by liberalizing trade and investment regimes to attract local and foreign direct investments.</p>\r\n<p>The challenge for both the Government and the ICCC is to effectively manage the negative impact of the resultant outcomes of trade liberalization. In line with this view, the ICCC will take necessary steps to protect market competition in the economy by taking appropriate action to address potential anti-competitive commercial arrangements head on. In doing this, it will also take measures to protect consumers\' interest where actions of businesses and industries may be potentially harmful to Papua New Guinean consumers, as well as providing an enabling environment for our businesses industries to be internationally efficient and competitive.</p>\r\n<p>We will provide the Government with appropriate policy recommendations to ensure impediments to competition is addressed in key industries so that efficiency gains can result in improved quality, lower prices and improved standards of goods and services.</p>\r\n<p>Our stakeholders must note that the ICCC plays a part though its competition role, relative to other organizations to ensure goods and services are affordable. For example, while inflation is related to the exchange rate, which strongly influenced by the capital flow and interest rate policies of the Bank of PNG; and the fiscal policies of the the Government of the day, it is also influenced by local production to replace imports and export of goods and services; and therefore the ICCC\'s focus on ensuring the impediments to competition are removed in key industries, is part of the bigger effort by all relevant stockholders. Thus, this will become our primary goal for the next three (3) years.</p>\r\n<p>To achieve these outcomes, this plan will guide the ICCC\'s investment in our staff, systems, processes and programmes for the next three (3) years. We intend to inform our stakeholders through this Plan of our values and how we endeavor to efficiently and effectively implement our core mandate.</p>\r\n<p>Amongst other investments, the ICCC will accelerate its initiatives to;</p>\r\n<ol type=\"1\">\r\n<li>better equip and train it\'s staff,</li>\r\n<li>complete its network configuration to ensure our regional offices are connected to our main server to have access to real-time data, our files and registers</li>\r\n<li>liaise with the Department of Finance to establish an internal audit office,</li>\r\n<li>organize regulatory, competition and consumer protection best practice conferences and workshops</li>\r\n<li>undertake key market and industry reviews to assist the Government with evidence based policy options;</li>\r\n<li>expand its consumer protection awareness and enforcement to provinces through an active program of periodic monitoring, inspections and engagements; and</li>\r\n<li>reform our legislation to strengthen our enforcement capabilities.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Over the last 13 years, the ICCC has made remarkable progress in discharging its mandate to and often has accepted additional responsibilities requested by Government through the Minister and has carried these out successfully. We intend to maintain this level of commitment into the future.</p>\r\n<p>The success of the 2017 - 2019 Corporate Plan will require the support of key policy and resourcing agencies such as the Department of Personnel Management, Treasury, and Finance, including other line agencies.</p>\r\n<p>We are looking forward to working with all our relevant stakeholders, and are committed to the priorities under this Corporate Plan, over the next three years.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong>PAULUS AIN</strong><br />Commissioner &amp; Chief Executive Officer</p>\r\n</div>','',1,95,'2018-01-03 02:03:59',560,'','2018-01-29 07:48:45',560,0,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2018-01-03 02:03:59','0000-00-00 00:00:00','{}','{}','{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\",\"sunfw_article_type\":\"standard\",\"sunfw_featured_image\":\"\",\"sunfw_audio_embed_code\":\"\",\"sunfw_link_title\":\"\",\"sunfw_link_url\":\"\",\"sunfw_quote_text\":\"\",\"sunfw_quote_author\":\"\",\"sunfw_video_url\":\"\"}',29,2,'','',1,5805,'{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}',0,'*',''),(224,2357,'Electricity','electricity','<div class=\"iccc-article-title\">\r\n<h3>Electricity</h3>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 class=\"iccc-article-sub-title\">The Electricity Industry</h4>\r\n<div class=\"iccc-article-text-content\">\r\n<p>The electricity supply industry was declared under Part IIIB, section 24C of the Electricity Industry Act 2002 (EIA) to be a regulated industry for the purposes of the ICCC Act.</p>\r\n<p>The Commission has among other regulatory functions under the EIA, the licensing functions that permits any person, firm or organisation that intends to operate in the electricity supply industry.</p>\r\n<p>The Commission administers four main Electricity undertaker licences which are:-</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Electricity Generation Licence;</li>\r\n<li>Electricity Transmission Licence;</li>\r\n<li>Electricity Distribution Licence; and</li>\r\n<li>Electricity Retail Licence.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 class=\"iccc-article-sub-title\">PNG Power Limited</h4>\r\n<div class=\"iccc-article-text-content\">\r\n<p>PNG Power Limited (“PNG Power”) is currently the major electricity provider in Papua New Guinea (“PNG”).

Goods','declared-goods','<div class=\"iccc-article-title\">\r\n<h3>Declared Goods</h3>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The Commission is tasked with the responsibility of regulating prices of certain declared goods that are declared by the Minister for Treasury. The Commission commenced its pricing reforms in 2004 for all the declared goods and these declared goods are the results of the pricing reforms and are declared by the Minister for Treasury for the purpose of price regulation. In determining the approach for regulation, the Commission has opted to apply the price monitoring approach in regulating these declared goods.</p>\r\n<h4 class=\"iccc-article-sub-title\">Ramu Suger Products</h4>\r\n<p>In its role of regulating prices of certain declared goods and services, the Commission has the responsibility to regulate prices of Ramu sugar products. Nearly all of the sugar products in Papua New Guinea (PNG) are manufactured and distributed by Ramu Agri Industries Limited (RAIL) and more recently other importers who import directly from overseas manufacturers and distribute packaged sugar products. Briefly, the current regulatory arrangements under the Prices Regulation Act (“PR Act”) Chapter 320, allows the Commission to monitor the ex-factory gate prices of Ramu sugar products supplied by RAIL on a monthly basis under the provisions of Section 32A of the PR Act and compares these price movements against the benchmark prices from the New Zealand Statistics and the National Statistics Office retail sugar prices.</p>\r\n<h4 class=\"iccc-article-sub-title\">Rice Products – 1 kg Roots Rice Brand</h4>\r\n<p>The Commission role in regulating the rice industry in PNG is very much centered on the Roots rice products supplied by Trukai Industries Limited (Trukai). As a declared good, Trukai is required to supply its factory gate pricelist of Roots rice to the Commission on a quarterly basis. The Commission collates these price movements and compares their movements to the data sourced from the New Zealand Statistics and the National Statistics Office.</p>\r\n<h4 class=\"iccc-article-sub-title\">Flour Industry Price Monitoring</h4>\r\n<p>Similar to the roots rice regime, the Commission also regulates and monitors the prices of flour products supplied by both Goodman Fielder Asia Pacific Limited with their brand of Flame flour and the 3-Roses flour supplied by the Niugini Tablebirds under the Mainland Holdings Limited. The Commission receives quarterly prices form these two flour suppliers and compares their price movement against the New Zealand Statistics available online for free access.</p>','',1,97,'2017-12-19 22:11:56',560,'','2018-03-18 04:56:41',560,0,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2017-12-19 22:11:56','0000-00-00 00:00:00','{\"image_intro\":null,\"image_intro_caption\":null,\"image_intro_alt\":null,\"image_fulltext\":null,\"image_fulltext_caption\":null,\"image_fulltext_alt\":null}','{}','{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\",\"sunfw_article_type\":\"standard\",\"sunfw_featured_image\":\"\",\"sunfw_audio_embed_code\":\"\",\"sunfw_link_title\":\"\",\"sunfw_link_url\":\"\",\"sunfw_quote_text\":\"\",\"sunfw_quote_author\":\"\",\"sunfw_video_url\":\"\"}',5,8,'','',1,1371,'{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}',0,'*',''),(246,2441,'Declared Services','declared-services','<div class=\"iccc-article-title\">\r\n<h3>Declared Services</h3>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"iccc-article-text-content\">\r\n<p>CCC regulates and monitors only the goods and services that are declared by the Minster for Treasury.

PMV &amp; Taxi Fares</h4>\r\n<p>The Commissions sets the PMV fares for all PMV routes in the country, both the urban and rural PMV routes, and also set he taxi fares especially in centres where taxi services are provided. Currently, taxi services are only provided in Port Moresby, Alotau and Rabaul. The regulatory period for PMV &amp; Taxi is set for five years, and taxi fares are adjusted annually. Core factors used by the Commission to determine the fares are fuel prices and CPI.</p>\r\n<h4 class=\"iccc-article-sub-title\">2.Petroleum Products</h4>\r\n<p>The 1997 Napa Napa Project Agreement between the State and InterOil sets the platform of the Petroleum Industry in the country. The Commission only administer the section of the project agreement that concerns the supply and pricing of the petroleum products, particularly petrol, diesel and kerosene. The Commission work alone side InterOil (now Puma Energy) on a monthly basis to calculate the Import Parity Prices (IPP) for these petroleum products and eventually determine monthly fuel prices, after incorporating quarterly domestic road and sea freights and kina exchange rates.</p>\r\n<h4 class=\"iccc-article-sub-title\">3. Water &amp; Sewerage</h4>\r\n<p>Under the current price control arrangement for Water &amp; Sewerage, the Commission determine the tariffs for the water and sewerage services in the country on annually basis since 2010. The two water companies are Eda Ranu, which provides the water and sewerage services only whit the vicinity of Port Moresby City, and Water PNG, which provides the services to other parts of the city apart from Port Moresby. These two companies submit to the Commission their tariff rate for the following year and the Commission approves it if the tariff falls within the price part set by the Commission. The current regulatory period will end in December 2014.</p>\r\n<h4 class=\"iccc-article-sub-title\">4. Stevedoring &amp; Handling</h4>\r\n<p>Unlike other three services, the Commission applies monitoring form of regulation to Stevedoring and Handling. Under this arrangement, the licensed stevedoring companies operating in the declared Ports within PNG submit to the Commission on a quarterly basis their stevedoring and handling charges and the Commission measured these charges against certain benchmark prices. If there is some form of divergence between the prices, the Commission seek clarifications form these Stevedoring companies and if the Commission is not satisfied, the Commission may propose to the Minister to declare the service for Direct Price Control.</p>\r\n</div>','',1,97,'2017-12-19 22:11:56',560,'','2018-03-18 04:59:30',560,0,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2017-12-19 22:11:56','0000-00-00 00:00:00','{\"image_intro\":null,\"image_intro_caption\":null,\"image_intro_alt\":null,\"image_fulltext\":null,\"image_fulltext_caption\":null,\"image_fulltext_alt\":null}','{}','{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\",\"sunfw_article_type\":\"standard\",\"sunfw_featured_image\":\"\",\"sunfw_audio_embed_code\":\"\",\"sunfw_link_title\":\"\",\"sunfw_link_url\":\"\",\"sunfw_quote_text\":\"\",\"sunfw_quote_author\":\"\",\"sunfw_video_url\":\"\"}',5,6,'','',1,1481,'{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}',0,'*',''),(247,2449,'Fuel Prices','fuel-prices','<div class=\"iccc-article-title\">\r\n<h3>Fuel Prices</h3>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"iccc-article-text-content\">\r\n<p>ICCC sets price margins and monitor fuel prices to ensure that retailers sell within that margin.</p>\r\n<p>The 1997 Napa Napa Project Agreement between the State and InterOil sets the platform of the Petroleum Industry in the country.

Such banning orders may apply for up to five years;</li>\r\n<li>The ICCC Act also includes rights of private action to redress loss or damage suffered as a result of a contravention of the ICCC Act, in recognition that such contraventions may have serious commercial consequences for competitors or potential competitors, or for suppliers or customers. Persons/businesses are all able to take their own legal action to protect themselves.

MRCs are defined forms of various commercial conduct that has anti-competitive purpose and/or effect in the market; and which are prohibited by the ICCC Act.</p>\r\n<p>In broad terms, the market conduct rules include the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Anti-Competitive Arrangements, s.50</strong>\r\n<p>S.50 of the ICCC Act prohibits contracts, arrangements or understandings that have the purpose, or have or is likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening competition in a market. That prohibition applies both to entering into such contracts, arrangements or reaching understandings and giving effect to a provision of such a contract, arrangement or understanding that has already been made or reached. It is a broad provision and applies to both horizontal (agreements between competitors) and vertical (agreements between persons in different supply chain) agreements.</p>\r\n<p>Any contract, arrangement or understandings entered into before 2003 are not enforceable.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Anti-Competitive Covenants, s.51</strong>\r\n<p>Covenants over land that have the purpose, or have or are likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening competition in a market are prohibited by s.50 of the ICCC Act. The prohibition extends to requiring someone to give a covenant, giving one yourself or seeking to enforce the covenant.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Exclusionary Provisions, s.52</strong>\r\n<p>S.52 prohibits exclusionary provisions which are also known as primary boycotts. This relates to provision of a contract, arrangement or understanding between two or more competitors that will prevent or limit their dealings with a particular person or class of persons, where the person who is the target of the boycott is a competitor of one or both of those who agree not to deal with him. This is a per se offence under the ICCC Act; but the defence is prove of no substantial lessening of competition.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Price fixing, s.53</strong>\r\n<p>S.53 prohibits entering into and giving effect of contracts, arrangements or understandings between competitors to fix price. It is defined broadly to include contracts, arrangements or understandings that have the purpose or effect or likely effect of fixing, controlling or maintaining the price for goods or services or any discount, allowance, rebate or credit. It is also a per se to enter into and give effect to price fixing agreements because they are deemed to have the purpose, effect or likely effect of substantially lessening competition. There are however, some exceptions to price fixing prohibition.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Taking Advantage of Market Power, s.58</strong>\r\n<p>The prohibition of such anti-competitive market behaviour may apply in a case where a person or company has a substantial degree of power in a market. Having market power or monopoly is not prohibited.</p>\r\n<p>The ICCC Act prohibits the act of taking advantage of that power in an anti-competitive manner to;</p>\r\n<ol type=\"a\">\r\n<li>restrict the entry of a person into that or any other market, or</li>\r\n<li>prevent or deter a person from engaging in competitive conduct in that or any other market; or</li>\r\n<li>eliminate a person from, that market or any other market.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Resale Price Maintenance, ss.59 and 60</strong>\r\n<p>Resale price maintenance, the practice of a supplier requiring a person not to sell its products below a certain price, is also prohibited. Thus, a supplier cannot insist or use treat or by any means, require that the supplied products are not sold below a certain price specified by the supplier. Resale price maintenance would also apply where a manufacturer threatens to refuse to supply a retailer who was discounting the manufacturer\'s products while others were not. The supplier is also not allowed to induce or attempt to induce to a person not sell the supplied products below a specified price.</p>\r\n<p>A price recommendation is allowed under s.61 of the ICCC Act. However, it should be clearly marked that the price is only a recommended price.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Business Acquisitions, s.69</strong>\r\n<p>The acquisition of assets or shares of a business that would have, or would likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in a market are prohibited by the ICCC Act.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>','',1,99,'2018-01-26 08:06:28',560,'','2018-01-27 23:55:22',560,0,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2018-01-26 08:06:28','0000-00-00 00:00:00','{}','{}','{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\",\"sunfw_article_type\":\"standard\",\"sunfw_featured_image\":\"\",\"sunfw_audio_embed_code\":\"\",\"sunfw_link_title\":\"\",\"sunfw_link_url\":\"\",\"sunfw_quote_text\":\"\",\"sunfw_quote_author\":\"\",\"sunfw_video_url\":\"\"}',7,2,'','',1,1162,'{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}',0,'*',''),(262,2474,'Mergers & Acquisitions ','mergers-acquisitions','<div class=\"iccc-article-title\">\r\n<h3>Mergers &amp; Acquisitions</h3>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"main\" style=\"overflow: auto;\">\r\n<div class=\"iccc-article-text-content\">\r\n<p>The ICCC Act also prohibits the acquisition of assets or shares of a business if the acquisition would result in a substantial lessening of competition in a market. The prohibition relates to the structure of the market rather than to the behavior in that market. Acquiring shares or assets of other business that would result in a substantial lessening of competition in a market without the approval of the ICCC is illegal.</p>\r\n<p>It is prohibited by law because the acquisition of one competitor by another can have just as much serious anti-competitive consequences as arrangements that substantially lessen competition.</p>\r\n<p>The ICCC Act allows the ICCC to formally approve business acquisition in specific circumstances. The processes for seeking approval are called Clearance and Authorisation; and are provided for under ss.81 and 82, respectively. The ICCC can grant a clearance (s.81) if it is satisfied that the proposed acquisition would not result in a substantial lessening of competition. Where clearance is sought, the ICCC only assesses the competition effects of the proposed acquisition.</p>\r\n<p>The ICCC can also grant an authorisation (s.82) for a business acquisition that would result in a substantial lessening of competition, if it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the ICCC that there would be positive public benefits which would outweigh the lessening of competition.</p>\r\n<p>Authorisation of business acquisition is a two staged process. The ICCC is first required to assess the competition effects of the proposed acquisition in the market, to determine whether the proposed acquisition would substantially lessening competition in the relevant market. If the ICCC is satisfied that there would not be such an adverse competitive effect, the ICCC must give a clearance for the proposed acquisition.

Information received by the ICCC in the past showed that the various EFTPOS machines in shops are owned by commercial banks,&rdquo; said Mr. Ain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Respective commercial banks supply EFTPOS machines to merchants/traders under some form of formal arrangement, usually in the form of a Merchant Agreement. In short, the ICCC established that the Merchant Agreement spells out the obligation of both parties and provides for avenues for the commercial banks as owners of the EFTPOS machines to penalise a merchant/trader that breaches the terms of the Merchant Agreement. For example, it allowed the commercial banks to repossess the machines should a merchant/trader breach the terms of the Merchant Agreement. In normal circumstance, the ICCC noted that a warning letter is issued by the commercial bank before an EFTPOS machine is withdrawn from the premises of the merchant/trader concerned.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In ICCC&rsquo;s investigation of similar cases in 2015, the ICCC was advised that the commercial banks charged merchants/traders a minimal monthly maintenance fee for the use of the machines and as part of the Merchant Agreement, merchants/traders were discouraged by commercial banks to charge customers additional transaction fees; but were encouraged to recoup this cost by passing this to customers through their normal mark-up of goods and or services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At present the ICCC is not privy to the current terms of the Merchant Agreements between commercial banks and the various merchants/traders in the country and therefore is uncertain if similar terms are still adopted and enforced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2015 cases that concerned the EFTPOS machine of a particular commercial bank, the ICCC strongly advised the commercial bank to approach the merchant/trader concerned and address the matter under the terms of the Merchant Agreement. They assured the ICCC that they would and consequently, the complaints were resolved between the commercial bank, the merchant/trader and the customers concerned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on these experiences, the ICCC&rsquo;s position is that, where Merchant Agreements between respective commercial banks and merchants/traders is in force, and where there are clauses that allow for the commercial banks to take corrective action similar to those described above, the commercial banks have a moral obligation to act and protect innocent customers who are aggrieved by unscrupulous traders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Ain said that commercial banks must enforce the relevant terms of their respective Merchant Agreements in the first instance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This is an alternate to them closing the merchants/traders&rsquo; bank accounts which obviously, is not in the commercial interest of the commercial banks. Nonetheless, the commercial banks must take the lead to address customers&rsquo; concerns concerning the use of their EFTPOS machines issued to merchants/traders.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Respective Merchant Agreements are private commercial contractual arrangements between the respective commercial banks and the merchants/traders. Under normal circumstances, each party should have a right to be heard and where one part acts contrary to the terms of the agreement; there are penalty provisions. It should also provide an avenue for dispute resolution, and where disputes cannot be amicably resolved; the court is the appropriate forum for addressing disputes. The consumer protection provisions of the ICCC Act restricts the ICCC from getting involve, to enforce or resolve matters that are contractual between parties; thus the ICCC cannot enforce the terms of the Merchant Agreement on behalf of the commercial banks for the benefit of consumer. This is the responsibility of the commercial banks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Ain emphasised that the ICCC does not set the monthly maintenance fees applicable to EFTPOS machines under the Merchant Agreement, nor does it set the fees that unscrupulous merchants/traders charge consumers for use of EFTPOS machines and therefore follows that the ICCC cannot enforce the proper EFTPOS fee(s), if there is indeed one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ICCC is of the view that the terms of the Merchant Agreement between commercial banks and merchants/traders covers this matter, thus commercial banks must act in the interest of aggrieved customers who are subject to the use of EFTPOS machines issued to merchants/traders by the commercial banks. Also if the terms of the Merchant Agreements are not effective nor workable, commercial banks need to look into alternate means to address the concerns of customers in so far as this relates to them paying extra fees for using commercial bank issued EFTPOS machines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ICCC welcomes an opportunity to discuss this matter with the commercial banks to assist them find a way to effectively addressing consumer concerns.</p>\r\n','',1,101,'2018-01-31 01:53:30',826,'','2018-02-27 05:26:10',826,0,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2018-01-31 01:55:30','0000-00-00 00:00:00','{\"image_intro\":\"images\\/iccc\\/common\\/article-images\\/default-hot-topic-article-featured-image-256x256-d1.jpg\",\"image_intro_caption\":null,\"image_intro_alt\":null,\"image_fulltext\":null,\"image_fulltext_caption\":null,\"image_fulltext_alt\":null}','{}','{}',8,1,'','',1,744,'{}',0,'',''),(268,2504,'ICCC Response to Media Questions about Transport','iccc-response-to-media-questions-about-transport','<h3>ICCC Response to Media Questions about Transport</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Independent Consumer and Competition Commission (ICCC) is responsible for the regulation of Public Motor Vehicle (PMV) and taxi fares in the country and sets the maximum PMV and Taxi fares for all declared routes nationwide. PMV and Taxi operators are to charge commuting consumers fares approved by ICCC.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nICCC Commissioner and CEO Paulus Ain said PMV and Taxi fares are regulated by ICCC under Section 21 of the Prices Regulation Act (PR Act).<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&ldquo;In the National Capital District market, it is evident that the demand for PMV services is higher than supply. This market situation is a contributing factor that forces PMV operators to over- charge commuters. PMVs also fail to observe certain service standards, such as the completion of routes or serving a route which they are not licensed to do so and the practice of overcharging by PMV operators is an on-going concern.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&ldquo;We have investigated and prosecuted a number of offending PMV operators through the Courts. These operators were fined and warned by the Courts to respect and comply with the fares set by the ICCC.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nIn addition Mr. Ain said the ICCC has on numerous occasions issued public notices on the approved fares, released media statements regarding the position of the Commission on PMV and Taxi fares; provided tips to commuters via the media on how to lodge a complaint; and advised the public of the outcome of the Court decisions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We have and are working with other relevant stakeholders to strengthen our enforcement efforts and powers. We will continue with these efforts and explore other options to effectively address this on-going area of concern.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;For example, prior to the establishment of the Road Transport Authority (RTA), we have previously liaised with the Department of Transport (DoT) on the possibility of a joint ICCC-DoT prosecution and suspension of PMV licenses by the Department for those found guilty by the Courts for over-charging passengers. We have also provided inputs to and supported DoT&rsquo;s effort to amend a suite of its legislations, regulations and guidelines. This includes changes to the rules on Traffic Rules for Passenger and Goods Transport. One of the aims of this exercise is to ensure that the Department, as the licensing authority, is equipped with adequate enforcement powers to take action against offending PMV operators. The ICCC will continue to further this and similar initiatives with the RTA.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Ain said the ICCC welcomes the proposed new premium transport services for NCD by the RTA and NCDC.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&ldquo;We perceive this proposal as a pro-competitive intervention as it will increase the number of private operators currently in the market. We are not aware of any talks to eliminate or do away with private operators therefore we expect the relevant authorities to retain the current private PMV operators. The ICCC would support steps taken by relevant authorities to tighten the licensing conditions to ensure current and future private PMV operators improve their service standards and adhere to public health rules and regulations.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&ldquo;Given PMV fares are fixed by the ICCC, the ICCC also supports measures that would increase competition amongst existing PMV operators as this can result in operators competing on non-price terms. This can entail operators improving the quality of their service by regularly cleaning their buses, replacing old seat covers and or seats and potentially replacing old PMV buses with new ones.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nMr. Ain said the ICCC is not privy to the intentions of the RTA and NCDC in regard to the recent advertisement for Expression of Interests (EOI) to contract private operators but notes that the steps taken by RTA and NCDC are generally consistent with their respective mandates aimed at addressed a public good.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&ldquo;The ICCC is also aware that the proposed private operators will offer premium services on special routes approved by the RTA; but on an initial trial basis to test if the service would be feasible before a final investment decision is made to roll this out on a full scale. Whilst the ICCC is supportive of interventions by relevant authorities aimed at benefiting consumers; it will monitor this development closely to ensure that the fares for the proposed premium PMV services are assessed objectively and carefully; and that the contractual arrangements put in place comply with the competition provisions under the ICCC Act.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe ICCC is still in discussions with relevant stakeholders and once a final decision is made on the route(s) and type of services, the ICCC will be involved in setting the PMV fares for the approved route(s) and services. Since the proposed new PMV operations would be of a superior service, it is likely that the proposed service would target a specific group of consumers who are willing to pay a higher fare to experience a superior PMV service.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nMr. Ain said the ICCC believes that this arrangement will create/introduce a new dimension in the way PMV services are structured and licensed for the benefit of consumers.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&ldquo;The ICCC understands that the proposed PMV service will service a different market to that serviced by the current PMV operators given the proposed service would operate on new routes; with potential for there to be minimal overlap between the routes. ICCC has not received any<br />\r\nindication from other centers, apart from NCD, concerning the provision of the proposed premium services for special routes.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nICCC currently sets PMV and Taxi fares in accordance with its Final Determinations set out in the &ldquo;2014 Final Report for PMV and Taxi Fare Review&rdquo; for routes which have been approved and gazetted by the then NLTB. Demand for transport services in most provinces throughout PNG is higher than supply, therefore, ICCC will continue to play an important role in the industry to ensure consumers are protected by regulating the price of PMV and Taxi services. However, it is important that all regulatory bodies of the transport industry continue to work together to ensure approved fares and other regulations such as the PMV and Tax licensing conditions set by the RTA and public health policies enforceable by NCDC (and others) as the delegated municipal authority are strictly enforced at all times.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nUnfortunately, there are no quick fix solutions to the issues of overcharging in the absence of other alternate affordable and reliable public transportation service where consumers can exercise their right to choose.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Ain said if there was, this would allow the transport market to correct itself to some extent in so far as influencing operator behaviour and quality of service.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;There are good laws governing the transport sector but unfortunately some operators continue to disregard these laws.

These petroleum products have been declared by the Minister for Treasury as &ldquo;declared services&rdquo; for the purpose of the Price Regulation Act.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the Napa Napa Project Agreement between the Government and InterOil (now Puma Energy), it is a requirement that Import Parity Pricing (&lsquo;IPP&rsquo;) must be used for setting retail prices for petroleum products in PNG. As per the Project Agreement, the IPP is the pricing formula that sets the benchmark prices for all refined petroleum products produced at the Napa Napa Refinery as if those products were imported from Singapore.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Singapore&rsquo;s refined product prices are the benchmark prices observed by all countries in the AsiaPacific Region, including PNG. The ICCC is not a party to the Project Agreement, hence; it has no say over the pricing arrangements for refined fuel products from Napa Napa. However, the ICCC only monitors and verifies the IPP to ensure that it is in compliance with the Project Agreement.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Ain added that in light of the fuel tax changes by the Government, the IPP will not be affected but the overall retail price or the IRP will increase.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The Government has approved for an increase in the excise duty for diesel from 10 toea per litre to 23 toea per litre, which will come into effective from 1st January, 2018. Due to the increase in excise, Government taxes [excise duty and GST] on diesel will account for 17.8% of the final retail price for diesel in 2018, which is an increase from 13.1% in 2017.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to ICCC&rsquo;s calculation, the increase in excise duty for diesel alone from 10 to 23 toea per litre will increase the final retail prices for diesel by approximately 5.75% in 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Ain said the new import duties of 10 toea per litre for both diesel and petrol will not be reflected in the final retail prices because they are not part of the IPP formula, which was agreed upon between InterOil (now Puma Energy) and the Government in the Project Agreement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Fuel importers will have to absorb the import duties in their margins. Therefore to avoid paying the import duty, fuel importers are encouraged to source fuel from Puma&rsquo;s Napa Napa Fuel Refinery.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The increase in the excise duty will likely have a cumulative effect on general inflation in 2018. Prices of goods and services will likely increase in 2018 as transport costs, amongst other costs, of providing these goods and services are likely to increase due to increase in fuel costs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Ain said that as a responsible regulator, the Commission is urging all Papua New Guineas to prepare for these new changes by the Government, and cut back on wasteful spending.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The ICCC has no control over the introduction of new fuel taxes.

An approval granted by the ICCC protects them from any future legal action that is brought under the ICCC Act on competition grounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hence, the ICCC is working with KCHL to follow due process and submit its applications for ICCC&rsquo;s assessment for clearance and/or authorization on the proposed merger.</p>\r\n','',1,89,'2018-03-22 03:50:54',826,'','2018-03-22 03:53:43',0,0,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2018-03-22 03:53:43','0000-00-00 00:00:00','{\"image_intro\":null,\"image_intro_caption\":null,\"image_intro_alt\":null,\"image_fulltext\":null,\"image_fulltext_caption\":null,\"image_fulltext_alt\":null}','{}','{}',2,4,'','',1,351,'{}',0,'',''),(335,0,'ICCC Awareness on Restrictive Trade Practices','iccc-awareness-on-restrictive-trade-practices','<div style=\'display:none;\'><!--(cbArticleId:335)--></div><ul class=\"category list-striped list-condensed\">\r\n<li class=\"cat-list-row0\"><strong class=\"list-title\">Title</strong>\r\n<div>ICCC Awareness on Restrictive Trade Practices</div>\r\n</li>\r\n \r\n<li class=\"cat-list-row0\"><strong class=\"list-title\">Document</strong>\r\n<div>{CBDownload field: publicnoticedoc; hide-size:true; hide-downloads: true; hide-filename: true; hide-mime: true;}</div>\r\n</li>\r\n </ul>','',1,90,'2018-03-22 04:02:47',826,'','0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,0,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2018-03-22 04:02:47','0000-00-00 00:00:00','','','',1,7,'','',1,630,'',0,'*',''),(336,2731,'ICCC advises consumers of product recall on Takata airbag inflator','iccc-advises-consumers-of-product-recall-on-takata-airbag-inflator','<p>The Independent Consumer and Competition Commission (ICCC) is aware of a product recall for all vehicles with defective Takata airbags by Australian Government, following an Australian Consumer and Competition Commission (ACCC) safety investigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recall was issued, based on extensive evidence provided by the ACCC, that vehicles with defective Takata airbags may cause injury to drivers and/or passengers, and one or more suppliers of vehicles with defective Takata airbags have not taken satisfactory action to prevent those vehicles causing injury to drivers and/or passengers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Globally, ruptures of defective Takata airbags have been associated with at least 23 deaths and 230 injuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ICCC Commissioner and Chief Executive Officer, Paulus Ain said that the ICCC undertook enquiries with various car dealers in Papua New Guinea to identify car dealers selling motor vehicles with Affected Takata Airbag Inflators, to establish whether car dealers and suppliers of the motor vehicles are aware of the compulsory recall, and to enquire on the steps taken by them to manage the recall and concerns of consumers that may be affected throughout the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ICCC noted that:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Concerned Motor Vehicle Manufacturer/s including Takata Corporation have&nbsp; formally advised its Distributors/Motor Dealers/Suppliers of its decision to voluntarily replace all defective Takata airbags in the listed motor vehicles of various makes and models sold to its consumers;</li>\r\n	<li>Management of affected Motor Car Dealers/Distributors have since set up processes and Management systems to help identify their affected clients and proceed with replacing the defective Takata airbag inflator;</li>\r\n	<li>Motor Car Dealerships concerned have set timelines to follow from the time of initial notification of recalls from their suppliers to actual repair work carried out and feedback; and</li>\r\n	<li>The Product Safety recall program for &ldquo;Safety Airbag Inflator&rdquo; replacement will be at no charge to the consumer/customer.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Commissioner Ain said ICCC understands that affected customers/clients who have purchased motor vehicles with faulty/ detective Takata airbags are required to contact their Motor Dealership/Distributor/Supplier or go in person without delay to book a date to have the service done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Customers are also required to provide the Vehicle Identification Number and registration number of their vehicle for verification.&rdquo; Commissioner Ain said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Affected customers and clients who have purchase motor vehicles through third parties are required to contact their dealer.

In 2011, the Government developed the Electricity Industry Policy (EIP) which recommended for competition in the generation sector of the electricity industry. This allowed Independent Power Producers (IPP) to compete with PPL however because PPL has an exclusive rights within 10kms radius of its transmission network, most of the IPPs had to enter into Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with PPL to supply power for general consumption.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commissioner Ain added that since 2011, there are eight licensed electricity undertakers including PPL operating in the country. Of these, five are IPPs generating and supplying power to PPL. These IPPs are; ExxonMobil PNG Limited, Posco Daewoo Limited, PNG Forest Products Limited and New Britain Palm Oil Limited and Daewoo PNG Power Limited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;During the Regulatory Contract Review undertaken by the ICCC in 2012, the findings recommended tariff increases for PPL to have PPL met its cost of operation, investment, perform competitively in the market and deliver better services to the people of PNG. These tariffs were to take effect in 2013.&rdquo; Commissioner Ain said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The Government however made a decision in 2013 to stop PPL from increasing the electricity tariff. This decision to freeze the tariff increase has been in effect since the second quarter of 2013. PPL still has the prerogative to request the Government to rescind its decision if it feels that the tariff freeze is burdening PPL&rsquo;s financial performance.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015, a mid-term review of PPL&rsquo;s Regulatory Contract revealed that most of the capital projects that were planned for implementation by 2015 were not achieved. Further review of the Industry by the ICCC in 2017 also showed that PPL was yet to implemented most of its capital projects allowed for under the 2013 to 2017 Regulatory Contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In light of the Government&rsquo;s decision to freeze tariff increase since 2013, PPL was unable to charge electricity services on cost reflective basis subsequently PPL was not able make reasonable returns to implement the planned projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Third Party Access (TPA) Codes and Grid Codes are administered by ICCC and basically provide guidance to power producers in terms of pricing and technical aspect of the commercial arrangements are competitive, least-cost reflective and ensure international best practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commissioner Ain said that despite of set-backs from the tariff-freeze issue, the regulatory framework overseen by the ICCC through the use of TPA Codes, Regulatory Contract and Licences, amongst others have remained fruitful with the introduction of competition within the generation segment of the electricity industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The ICCC has ensured that the economic regulation of the industry remained relevant and in-tuned with the prevailing market conditions.

As a result, the review of this Authorization application did not proceed until on 30th January, 2018, when KCHL formally advised the ICCC to recommence the assessment of its Authorization application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ICCC Commissioner and Chief Executive Officer, Paulus Ain said this decision relates to the Authorization application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Authorization is a statutory process under the <em>Independent Consumer and Competition Commission Act 2002</em> (<strong>&ldquo;</strong>ICCC Act<strong>&rdquo;</strong>) that allows a business to seek exemption to proceed to engage in a business conduct that may otherwise raise competition concerns for the ICCC such as the acquisition of assets or shares of another business that would seriously harm competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commissioner Ain said, &ldquo;The Authorization test is that the net benefits to the society must be greater than the detriments likely to result from the conduct subject of an Authorization application; in this case the Proposed Merger of Telikom and DataCo&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The ICCC may grant Authorization for the Applicants to proceed with the merger <em>if it is broadly satisfied that the benefits will result, or will be likely to result, from it will outweigh any detriments &nbsp;to the community.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commissioner Ain further said that the proposed merger has been carefully considered consistent with these requirements and it has been conducted through a transparent consultation process by seeking the views and comments from industry participants, players, stakeholders and the general public. Based on this thorough process and the ICCC&rsquo;s own independent assessment of the telecommunication&rsquo;s industry market, the ICCC has considered that the Proposed Merger will affect the following relevant markets:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>The market for provision of international data transmission and connectivity which supports dark fibre, bit-rate and managed data services (that is, all three layers 1, 2 and 3 services);</li>\r\n	<li>The market for provision of domestic data transmission and connectivity which supports dark fibre, bit-rate and managed data services.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In its consideration of the likely effects on competition if the Proposed Merger proceeds, amongst others, the ICCC has formed the following conclusions:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>the ICCC considers that, although DataCo may be an &ldquo;insignificant&rdquo; player now, it can be a sustainable and effective competitor in the future, should sufficient investment is made in it hence it is considered that this merger will eliminate a potential competitor;</li>\r\n	<li>the ICCC also considered that the barriers to entry are high, hence the market position of the merged firm would be greatly enhanced because it would control the essential network infrastructures currently available in PNG;</li>\r\n	<li>although satellite is an available substitute, usage of fibre optic cables is a more efficient and better means of carrying traffic because it significantly reduces signal latency for voice calls and its bandwidth can be more easily enhanced over time;</li>\r\n	<li>the ICCC also considered that there is a real likelihood of the merged entity engaging in discriminatory pricing. However, the ICCC and NICTA has agreed to work together to address this concern. Appropriate regulatory measures will be put in place to address this concern.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>In its consideration of the likely public benefit claims, the ICCC took into account submissions and comments from stakeholders and interested parties. The ICCC has concluded that the following benefits will result from the Proposed Merger, should it proceeds:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Potential for increased price competition and consequent retail price reduction to end users;</li>\r\n	<li>Innovation and increased investment in new technology, hence the technical knowledge and skills gained by national employees;</li>\r\n	<li>Improved backhaul networks and greater access to the use of backhaul networks for retail operators which will benefit the end users of data and voice services;</li>\r\n	<li>Improved economic activity and efficiency for the parties in the long run; and</li>\r\n	<li>As a result of more aggressive competition in retail service offerings, there will be greater penetration of higher bandwidth data and voice services into smaller towns and rural locations which is currently enjoyed as a near monopoly by Digicel (which provides services at a lower bandwidth).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>As mentioned, the Authorization test is that, <em>the overall benefits from this acquisition must be greater than the detriments (which includes the substantial lessening of competition). </em>&nbsp;If so, then the ICCC must grant Authorization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commissioner Ain said that the ICCC has also concluded that the Proposed Merger, if it proceeds, will result in some serious detriments in substantially lessening competition and waste of public funds if the claimed benefits and efficiencies are not realized post-merger.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Weighing the likely benefits to the community against the potential detriments (which includes substantial lessening of competition), the ICCC has considered that there are considerable benefits to the community that will result from the merger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To minimize potential anti-competitive discrimination and restriction of access to essential network infrastructures, bring greater efficiency benefits into the telecommunication industry, and ensure that the benefits of this transaction outweigh any detriments, the ICCC wants to see that there is sufficient access readily available to incumbents and potential new entrants who have network or ISP licenses and require wholesale data transmission services. Hence, potential new entrants may enter the market and provide sufficient competition against the incumbents; hence the realization of the benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commissioner Ain said the ICCC is working with NICTA to ensure appropriate conditions are imposed to ensure access to essential infrastructures are readily available to potential new entrants.

This code-sharing arrangement is the first between Air Niugini and Fiji Airways since their existence. Air Niugini will be operating the services between Port Moresby and Nadi.&rdquo; Commissioner Ain said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In assessing this application, the ICCC conducted a wider public consultation. The ICCC also released its Draft Determination for public and stakeholders&rsquo; comments on its assessment of the application and its reasoning for its proposed decision. The views of industry participants as well as other interested stakeholders were taken into consideration in finalising this Determination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commissioner Ain said: &ldquo;The ICCC has considered the principal market to be the market for the provision of air passenger services between Port Moresby and Fiji. It is also considered that the services from Australian ports to Fiji may have some competitive pressure on the principal market. For the purposes of assessing this application, the ICCC has considered the relevant market is the provision of regular air passenger services between PNG and Fiji, in particular, the Port Moresby and Nadi ports.&rdquo;<em> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, only Air Niugini is servicing the Port Moresby/Nadi (POM/NAN) route (via Honiara). Therefore, the ICCC believes this code-share arrangement would provide an opportunity for another carrier in Fiji Airways to enter the market through partnering with Air Niugini; and eventually grow its market share on the route; and may enter into a more competitive form of code-share arrangement or enter the market as an independent carrier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In its assessment of the public benefits this code-share is likely to generate, the ICCC has considered that the following would be achieved in the long run:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Travellers&rsquo; choice of marketing carriers would be increased (from one to two as currently it is only Air Niugini);</li>\r\n	<li>The arrangement would develop the route and make Port Moresby as a transit hub for passengers from New Zealand, United States, Honiara, Fiji and other Pacific Island nations to Asia and vice versa. This would increase traffic volume through Port Moresby and make it possible for more frequent services therefore, reducing passenger flight times to Asian destinations. This outcome would also lead to cheaper fares in the long run as a result of increased passenger volumes;</li>\r\n	<li>The possibility of Fiji Airways (and other Pacific carriers) to enter PNG market independently after growing its market share on this route; and</li>\r\n	<li>Provision of direct and increased frequency services.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides other likely detriments that may result from this proposed code-share, the ICCC also noted that the &lsquo;free sale&rsquo; code-share arrangement does not promote strong competition between the code-share partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hence, to minimise any potential anti-competitive effects and other related detriments to the public, the ICCC has imposed certain conditions to the Authorization. Amongst others, the following are the key conditions;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Air Niugini must price and sell its code-share services independently of Fiji Airways;</li>\r\n	<li>Air Niugini must revise its wholesale prices offered to Fiji Airways down once profitability is reached through increased passenger and freight volumes;</li>\r\n	<li>If, during the period of the Authorization, either of the parties increases airfares excessively without any valid justification on the code-share services, the ICCC will review the Authorization, pursuant to Section 80 of the ICCC Act, as such events may undermine the likely public benefits that this Authorization is based upon. The ICCC will then consider whether the balance between public detriment and public benefit still favours net public benefit;</li>\r\n	<li>Air Niugini is to submit annual code-share passenger and freight traffic volume reports to the ICCC, for the POM/NAN route; and&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Commissioner Ain said: &ldquo;Overall, the ICCC is satisfied that this code-share will result in more benefits to the public outweighing the potential detriments to competition in the market and other detriments. The ICCC therefore granted Authorization for a period of three years.</p>\r\n','',1,89,'2018-06-01 04:22:44',826,'','2018-06-01 04:26:15',0,0,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2018-06-01 04:26:15','0000-00-00 00:00:00','{\"image_intro\":null,\"image_intro_caption\":null,\"image_intro_alt\":null,\"image_fulltext\":null,\"image_fulltext_caption\":null,\"image_fulltext_alt\":null}','{}','{}',2,13,'','',1,264,'{}',0,'',''),(378,0,'IRP Notice for Fuel Prices for June 2018','irp-notice-for-fuel-prices-for-june-2018','<div style=\'display:none;\'><!--(cbArticleId:378)--></div><ul class=\"category list-striped list-condensed\">\r\n<li class=\"cat-list-row0\"><strong class=\"list-title\">Title</strong>\r\n<div>IRP Notice for Fuel Prices for June 2018</div>\r\n</li>\r\n \r\n<li class=\"cat-list-row0\"><strong class=\"list-title\">Document</strong>\r\n<div>{CBDownload field: publicnoticedoc; hide-size:true; hide-downloads: true; hide-filename: true; hide-mime: true;}</div>\r\n</li>\r\n </ul>','',1,90,'2018-06-07 01:45:56',826,'','0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,0,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2018-06-07 01:45:56','0000-00-00 00:00:00','','','',1,4,'','',1,385,'',0,'*',''),(379,2954,'ICCC Announces Retail Fuel Prices for June 2018','iccc-announces-retail-fuel-prices-for-june-2018','<p>The Independent Consumer and Competition Commission (<strong>&ldquo;ICCC&rdquo;</strong>) announces the new retail fuel prices for this month which will take effect on Friday, 8th June, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the ICCC&rsquo;s calculations, retail fuel prices for petrol, diesel and kerosene will all increase throughout PNG as of 8th June, 2018.

The demand has eventually eased off due to the completion of the PNG LNG Project, however, the hotel room rates have never subsided.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;</strong>In the last two or three years, there were more developments in hotel industry adding to new additional room with the expectation of the 2018 APEC Summit, hence, Port Moresby city appears to be well-positioned to meet an anticipated surge in foreign delegates arrival, despite delays on several high profile planned projects in the country.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commissioner Ain added that although there has been increase in the supply of hotel rooms, this is not reflected in the rates. Comparably, they are more expensive than some of the best hotels you find in another jurisdiction, including our very close neighbour economies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The room rates seem to be continuously increasing over the years, when will it decrease or when will the room rates come down?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ICCC views that supply of hotel rooms can be in excess of demand. This, according to Commissioner Ain, can cause a situation where some hotels can experience high room vacancy with falling revenue and profit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commissioner Ain said that given the increase in hotel rooms in Port Moresby compared to previous years, the hotel rates should be responsive to supply change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The room rates should decrease as the supply increases. Hotel supply has increased dramatically over the years in Port Moresby, but this change has not been reflected in the hotel room rates. The hotel room rates seem to be increasing significantly over the years.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the consumer watchdog, the ICCC is strongly urging all hoteliers to charge their rates prudently based on the real costs and the prevailing market conditions rather than on perception or historical trend or basing their price on their competitor&rsquo;s rate. If the hotels reduce their room rates, we can encourage more tourist coming to our country, it can also increase potential investors coming to our country to look for potential investment opportunities and finally we can have more people travelling to PNG during the APEC period.&nbsp; can benefit our APEC delegates and the country as a whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Commissioner Ain said all consumers have the right to choice, hence, they are encouraged to exercise their power of choice in seeking alternatives, if, a particular hotel room rates are excessive. That opportunity is limited given the current supply, therefore, price gouging by hoteliers should avoided.</p>\r\n','',1,89,'2018-08-14 04:26:20',826,'','2018-08-14 04:27:50',0,0,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2018-08-14 04:27:50','0000-00-00 00:00:00','{\"image_intro\":null,\"image_intro_caption\":null,\"image_intro_alt\":null,\"image_fulltext\":null,\"image_fulltext_caption\":null,\"image_fulltext_alt\":null}','{}','{}',2,18,'','',1,162,'{}',0,'',''),(386,2982,'Increase in Telikom Data Rates','increase-in-telikom-data-rates','<p>The Independent Consumer and Competition Commission (ICCC) is aware of the recent increase in data rates for the 4G services offered by Kumul Telikom Limited (Telikom).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ICCC Commissioner and Chief Executive Officer, Mr Paulus Ain, said &ldquo;We express grave concern over the very high increase on the data rates.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Ain stated that the ICCC&rsquo;s role is not only to protect consumers from harmful business conduct; but to also ensure that business are able to compete fairly and effectively in a market so that they can earn sufficient profits to continue to invest in the business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Businesses should not be restrained from being able to charge rates for the services and products they provide. However, such rates should be fair and reasonable and that should reflect actual investments costs for the business in providing the service or product.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the meantime, the ICCC advises the public to exercise their choice if they feel aggrieved by the new data rates offered by the two companies and seek other alternative services provided by other operators that offer the same 4G services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whilst the exponential increase in Telikom&rsquo;s data rates may be detrimental to consumers, the ICCC is limited in terms of its regulatory powers to take remedial actions. Currently, the ICCC does not regulate the prices of data services; hence, it cannot take actions against such increases that may be over and above a fair or reasonable price.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consumers have protected rights under the ICCC Act. One of the most important rights being the &ldquo;right to choice&rdquo;. Depending on the facts surrounding the allegations of inflated prices, the ICCC may insist on Telikom to justifying its costs. In this regard, the ICCC will establish a dialogue with both Telikom and the industry regulator, the National Information and Communications Technology Authority (NICTA), to ascertain the basis of the sudden increase in the data rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ICCC understands that an employee of Telikom came out in one of the dailies claiming that the increases were due to costs of vandalism and maintenance. The ICCC believes these reasons are not sufficient to justify a very huge increase because price increase may be spread overtime to recover such costs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ICCC reiterates that Telikom should be reasonable and charge a price that is reflective of its costs so that they earn a fair return on their investment. Telikom should act as a good corporate citizen and be ethical in its conduct; and not using its near monopoly position in data services to their advantage by inflating prices unnecessarily to the detriment of the consumers.

It only further increases the divide and public misconception on the role of the ICCC in the Information, Communications and Technology (ICT) Industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Ain said under the <em>National Information Communications Technology Act 2010</em>, NICTA is the ICT regulator and it is entirely responsible for setting the tariff/rates, attending to consumer complaints, issuing licences, setting interconnection rates and monitoring their service standards of all its licences and all other players in the ICT industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is imperative to note that prior to 2010, the ICCC was the economic regulator of the telecommunication industry and that it was responsible for setting the tariff/prices of telecommunication services and the inter-connection rates between the competing telecommunication service providers. During that time, the Papua New Guinea Telecommunication and Radio-communication Technical Authority (PANGTEL) was the technical regulator of the industry responsible for, amongst other things, issuance of spectrum licenses and bandwidths to industry participants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, n 2010, the Government repelled the <em>Telecommunications Act</em> and replaced it with the NICTA Act 2010 and it established a new Authority called the National Information and Communications Technology Authority (NICTA). The new Authority or NICTA took over the role of the former PANGTEL as the technical regulator and the economic regulatory function of the ICCC that were previously performed by the ICCC and PNAGTEL.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Ain said, since 2010, NICTA is the legislated or mandated Authority responsible for both the economic and technical regulation for the entire ICT industry. Amongst other economic regulatory functions of the ICCC that has been transferred to NICTA includes; setting of the prices or rates of mobile and fixed line telephony services, wholesale internet bandwidth rates, interconnection rates for mobile and fixed line telephony, monitoring of the service standards and issuance of operator licences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Ain said prior to 2010, the ICCC has many success stories as the economic regulatory of the telecommunications industry, one that stands out today is the successful issuance of mobile operator&rsquo;s licence to Digicel PNG Limited in 2007.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adding to this Commissioner Ain said, &ldquo;It is therefore important for all concerned stakeholders to understand that NICTA is the telecommunication industry regulator by law and is directly responsible for regulating the prices of telecommunication services and service standards of the&nbsp; operators in that industry. It [NICTA] is the sector specific regulator of the telecommunication industry and is duty bound to perform its mandated role under its legislation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Users of telecommunication services also need to know that NICTA has a consumer affairs branch that deals with Information Communication Technology (ICT) service queries. This facility can be utilized by aggrieved consumers.&rdquo; Commissioner Ain said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consistent with Government policy, the ICCC, as an implementation agency, only regulates the prices of Electricity, Water, Fuel, Essential Port Services, Motor Vehicles 3rd Party Insurance premiums, Postal Services, PMV and Taxi Fares. It also monitors the factory gate prices of Rice, Flour and Sugar but does not set the prices of these goods. Commissioner Ain added that prices of all other goods and services in the PNG economy are determined by the market forces of demand and supply or by industry/sector specific regulators where these are subject to regulations; and not the ICCC.&nbsp; All stakeholders need to be informed and educated about these facts. Unfortunately, Minister Duma has miss interpreted the facts. Similarly, many consumers and the general public also continue to misinterpret the facts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commissioner Ain added that given the ICCC continues to maintain its competition and consumer watchdog role, it continues to receive consumer complaints regarding telecommunication issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;In most cases, these are referred to NICTA to investigate as the sector regulator because NICTA is best placed to deal with these complaints and queries. NICTA has successfully assisted customers on the same with and without the assistance of the ICCC.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Thus, concerned users of telecommunication goods and services should not shy away from approaching NICTA directly and request that it investigates their complaints and queries. Where complaints are laid with the ICCC, these will be referred to NICTA to assess and resolve.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In closing, Commissioner Ain said the ICCC will continue to work with NICTA, the sector regulator, on issues requiring our joint competency.</p>\r\n','',1,89,'2018-09-04 01:22:41',826,'','2018-09-04 01:25:18',0,0,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2018-09-04 01:25:18','0000-00-00 00:00:00','{\"image_intro\":null,\"image_intro_caption\":null,\"image_intro_alt\":null,\"image_fulltext\":null,\"image_fulltext_caption\":null,\"image_fulltext_alt\":null}','{}','{}',2,22,'','',1,371,'{}',0,'',''),(390,0,'Indicative Retail Prices Notice - 7th September 2018','indicative-retail-prices-notice-7th-september-2018','<div style=\'display:none;\'><!--(cbArticleId:390)--></div><ul class=\"category list-striped list-condensed\">\r\n<li class=\"cat-list-row0\"><strong class=\"list-title\">Title</strong>\r\n<div>Indicative Retail Prices Notice - 7th September 2018</div>\r\n</li>\r\n \r\n<li class=\"cat-list-row0\"><strong class=\"list-title\">Document</strong>\r\n<div>{CBDownload field: publicnoticedoc; hide-size:true; hide-downloads: true; hide-filename: true; hide-mime: true;}</div>\r\n</li>\r\n </ul>','',1,90,'2018-09-07 00:32:02',826,'','0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,0,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2018-09-07 00:32:02','0000-00-00 00:00:00','','','',1,1,'','',1,127,'',0,'*',''),(391,2990,'RETAIL FUEL PRICES - SEPTEMBER, 2018','retail-fuel-prices-september-2018','<p>The Independent Consumer and Competition Commission (<strong>&ldquo;ICCC&rdquo;</strong>) hereby announces the new retail fuel prices for this month which will take effect on Saturday, 08th September, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the ICCC&rsquo;s calculations, retail fuel prices for petrol, diesel and kerosene will all increase throughout PNG as of 08th September, 2018.
